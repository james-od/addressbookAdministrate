                <p>This is a small web application that models an addressbook. Contacts and organisations can be added and viewed. To add a contact you must first ensure the organisation they are in has already been added. The contact can then be added under the same organisation name.
                </br>
                I'm trying to focus on fulfilling the requirements exactly. Although I feel I have met them there a several flaws in my design and implementation.  As the recommended time was only four hours I thought it best to leave these flaws provided the requirements were met.
