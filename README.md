# addressbookAdministrate
A simple address book web app.

Hello,

I'll try and give a summary of my approach and thought process approaching this below, which I can expand on later in person. 

This is my first time properly working with anything web related, so I knew going into this that the four hours recommended would be slightly ambitious. This also made it somewhat difficult for me to sit down and plan my approach as I usually would, so I had to take a less structured approach. I first went through the document and wrote out requirements as a list in a notebook. I then spent a while flicking through tutorials and fiddling with test code. Then I got down as much as I could with that knowledge and then worked from there to create something presentable.

I'm reasonably happy with the front end and I believe it meets all the requirements, although there are a lot of ways it could be improved. The back end is messy and dumb in places. I feel like if I was given a similar task again I would be able to produce something considerably better in far less time as I learned a lot throughout. 

I really enjoyed it as an exercise as it was something new while still letting me apply some of my existing knowledge. I'm looking forward to discussing it and other (likely better) approaches I could have taken at the next stage of my application.

Thanks for your time,

James
